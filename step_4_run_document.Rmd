Comparison between raw, clean and fabricated data: 
=====================================     

Inputs {.sidebar data-width=400}
-------------------------------------

```{r}
selectInput(
  "facet_var",
  "What variable do you want to facet by?",
  plots$facet_by,
  selected = plots$facet_by[1],
  multiple = FALSE
)

```

* Raw data is sourced from [Economic Development](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/economic-development/industry/bc-major-projects-inventory/recent-reports) with no processing.

* Clean data corrects for two main problems in the data:
  + Mis-categorization: some projects change categories mid-project. 
  + Missing values, both explicit (the presence of an absence i.e. value recorded as NA) and implicit (the absence of a presence i.e. project missing from MPI).

* In order to clean the data:
  + For each project the reported categories are replaced with that project's modal (most common) reported category.
  + Implicit missing values are converted to explicit missing values by left joining 1) a regular grid of quarterly dates with 2) the observed data.
  + Finally the explicit missing variables (estimated_cost, telephone, project_status, first_entry_date) are "updown" filled:  First missing values are filled up (backwards in time) and then down (forwards in time).

*  Fabricated data replaces remaining NA values (projects that have never reported an estimated cost) with a guess of the estimated cost.
*  The guess is the mean of: 
    + The average estimated cost for all projects of the same construction_type, construction_subtype, project_type and project_category_name.
    + 15M, which is the minimum project size to be considered "Major".
